            <p id="para">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and
                styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as
                SVG, MathML or XHTML).[2] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
                JavaScript.[3] <br> <br>

                CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and
                fonts.[4] This separation can improve content accessibility, since the content can be written without
                concern for its presentation; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
                characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a
                separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the
                .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its
                formatting. <br> <br>

                Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different
                styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser
                or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternative formatting
                if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[5] <br> <br>

                The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which declaration applies if
                more than one declaration of a property match a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is
                predictable.

                The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME
                type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS
                validation service for CSS documents.[6] <br> <br>

                In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and
                XUL. CSS is also used in the GTK widget toolkit.

            <p id="para2">
                CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the language used to describe the presentation of HTML elements on a
                webpage. A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block. The selector targets specific HTML
                elements such as <code>p</code>, <code>h1</code>, <code>.class</code>, or <code>#id</code>. The
                declaration block, enclosed in curly braces <code>{}</code>, contains one or more property-value pairs
                that define how the selected elements should appear. <br> Each property, like <code>color</code>,
                <code>font-size</code>, or <code>margin</code>, is followed by a colon and a value, and ends with a
                semicolon. For example, <code>p { color: blue; font-size: 18px; }</code> will make all paragraph text
                blue and set the font size to 18 pixels. br>
                CSS can be written inline within HTML tags, internally within a
                <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> block, or externally in a separate . <br>css file. The "cascading" nature of
                CSS
                means that styles are applied based on priority rules, including location, specificity, and the use of
                <code>!important</code>. This structure allows developers to create visually appealing, responsive, and
                well-organized web pages.
